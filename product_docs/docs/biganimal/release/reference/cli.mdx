title: Using the BigAnimal CLI
---

Use the command line interface (CLI) for BigAnimal management activities such as cluster provisioning and getting cluster status from your terminal. The CLI is an efficient way to integrate with BigAnimal and enables system administrators and developers to script and automate the BigAnimal administrative operations.

## Installing the CLI

The CLI is available for Linux, MacOS, and Windows operating systems.

### Download the binary executable

-   For Linux operating systems, use the following command to get the latest version of the binary executable:
    ```
    curl -LO "https://cli.biganimal.com/download/$(uname -s)/$(uname -m)/latest/biganimal"
    ```

-   For all operating systems, download the executable binary [here](https://cli.biganimal.com/).

### (Optional) Validate the download

-   For Linux users:
    1. Copy the SHA256 checksum code for Linux distribution from the [BigAnimal CLI](https://cli.biganimal.com) page and store it as a local file such as `biganimal_linux_amd64.sha256`. Alternatively, click on the SHA256 code to download it as a file directly and verify the content of the downloaded file is identical to the checksum code showed on the page.
    2. From your local shell, validate the binary executable file against the checksum file:
        ```
        echo "$(<biganimal_linux_amd64.sha256) biganimal" | sha256sum --check
        ```

-   For Windows users:
    1. Download the SHA256 checksum code for Windows distribution from the [BigAnimal CLI](https://cli.biganimal.com) page and store it as a local file such as `biganimal_windows_amd64.sha256`. Alternatively, click on the SHA256 code to download it as a file directly and verify the content of the downloaded file is identical to the checksum code showed on the page.
    2.  Validate the binary executable file against the checksum file using `CertUtil`:
        ```
        CertUtil -hashfile biganimal.exe SHA256 type biganiml_windows_amd64.sha256
        ```
- For MacOS users:
    1. Download the SHA256 checksum code for MacOS distribution from the [BigAnimal CLI](https://cli.biganimal.com) page and store it as a local file such as `biganimal_darwin_amd64.sha256`. Alternatively, click on the SHA256 code to download it as a file directly and verify the content of the downloaded file is identical to the checksum code showed on the page.
    2. From MacOS terminal, validate the binary executable file against the checksum file:
        ```
        echo "$(<biganimal_darwin_amd64.sha256)  biganimal" | shasum -a256 -c
        ```
## Command reference
Biganimal CLI is designed to be self-documented, users could easily find how to use it with the helps of following features.

### Auto completion
The CLI supports command line auto completion for bash, fish, powershell, and zsh. The following command describes how to set auto completion up for each shell:

```shell
$ biganimal completion
```

### Usage and examples
Use the `-h` or `--help` flags for more information on the CLI commands. You can use these flags on the `biganimal` command to get a listing of all the available subcommands (`biganimal -h`) or on a subcommand to get information on that particular command (for example, `biganimal create-cluster -h`).

### Interactive mode
The CLI supports user to compose the command line in an interactive mode, CLI will prompt you the missing mandatory flags you need to specify, and list the available options under current context for you to select when possible. The following command enables the interactive mode:

```shell
$ biganimal config set interactive_mode on
```

## Authenticate as a valid user

Before using the CLI to manage BigAnimal, you need to authenticate as a valid BigAnimal user. Use the `create-credential` command to authenticate, get an access token, and store it in a local credential. For example:

```
$ biganimal create-credential --name ba-user1 --address portal.biganimal.com  --port 443
Querying Authentication Endpoint for 'portal.biganimal.com
First, copy your one-time code:
         CWWG-SMXC
Then visit: https://auth.biganimal.com/activate
press [Enter] to continue in the web browser...

Credential "ba-user1" created!
```

You can create multiple credentials for different BigAnimal accounts and then set one as context of your current management session. Use `show-credentials` to list all available credentials and use `config set context_credential` to set a default credential for the current context. For example:

```
$ biganimal show-credentials
┏━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┓
┃ Credentials                                                                                         ┃
┣━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━━┫
┃ Name     ┃ Address                     ┃ Port ┃ TokenType ┃ AccessToken ┃ RefreshToken ┃ IdToken    ┃
┣━━━━━━━━━━╋━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━╋━━━━━━╋━━━━━━━━━━━╋━━━━━━━━━━━━━╋━━━━━━━━━━━━━━╋━━━━━━━━━━━━┫
┃ ba-user1 ┃ portal.biganimal.com ┃ 443  ┃ Bearer           ┃ **********  ┃ **********   ┃ ********** ┃
┃ ba-user2 ┃ portal.biganimal.com ┃ 443  ┃ Bearer           ┃ **********  ┃ **********   ┃ ********** ┃
┗━━━━━━━━━━┻━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┻━━━━━━┻━━━━━━━━━━━┻━━━━━━━━━━━━━┻━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┻━━━━━━━━━━━━┛
$ biganimal config set context_credential ba-user1
The credential ba-user1 has been set up
```

## Configuring
The initial running of the CLI creates a hidden configuration folder in your user root directory. For example, for Linux it’s `${HOME}/.edb-cli`. The CLI persists the configuration file in this directory as well as the credentials.

Don’t edit files in this directory directly. Instead, use `config` subcommand to list and update configuration setting of the CLI. Following command shows the usage and available configurations in detail:
```shell
$ biganimal config
```

### Available configuration settings

| Setting              | Description                                                      |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `context_credential` | The default credential used in all the following management commands |
| `output_mode`        | The command line output format, available output format includes: table, json, xml, yaml    |
| `confirm_mode`       | If enabled, create/update/delete commands require user's confirmation |
| `interactive_mode`   | If enabled, CLI will prompt missing flags for user to input in an interactive mode |
| `check_update_mode`  | If enabled, CLI will detect new update automatically and prompt for download |


## Sample use cases

### Create a cluster in interactive mode

The default mode for the `create-cluster` command is an interactive mode that guides you through the required cluster configuration by providing you with the valid values.

!!!Tip
You can turn off prompting by first using the `biganimal disable-prompt` command. With prompting disabled, if there are any missing required flags, the CLI exits.
!!!

```shell
$ biganimal create-cluster
Cluster Name: my-biganimal-cluster
Password: ************
Postgresql Type: EDB Postgres Advanced Server
Postgresql Version: 14
Provider: Azure
Region: (US) East US

    P80 (32 Ti, 20,000 Provisioned IOPS, 900 Provisioned MB/s)



```

You are prompted to confirm you want to create the cluster. After the cluster creation process is completed, it generates a cluster ID.

```
$ biganimal create-cluster
........
Are you sure you want to Create Cluster ? [y|n]: y
Create Cluster operation is started
Cluster ID is "p-c5rrnksgkgomjq0139s0"
To check current state, run: biganimal status-cluster --id p-c5rrnksgkgomjq0139s0
```

Check your cluster was created successfully using the `show-cluster-status` command:

```
$ biganimal show-cluster-status --id p-c5rrnksgkgomjq0139s0
Cluster "my-biganimal-cluster" status is "Cluster in healthy state"
```

### Create a cluster using a configuration file

You can use the `--clusterConfigFile` command to create one or more clusters with the same configuration in a noninteractive mode.

Here is a sample configuration file in YAML format:

```
# config_file.yaml
        ---
        clusterName: biganimal_cluster          # <string:  cluster name>
        password: ************                  # <string:  cluster password (must be at least 12 characters)>
        postgresType: epas                      # <string:  postgresType id>
        postgresVersion: "14"                   # <string:  postgres version>
        provider: azure                         # <string:  cloud provider id>
        region: francecentral                   # <string:  provider region id>
        instanceType: azure:Standard_E2s_v3     # <string:  instance type id>
        volumeProperties: P1                    # <string:  volume properties id>
        volumeType: azurepremiumstorage         # <string:  volume type id>
        networking: public                      # <string:  input "private" or "public" network>
        highAvailability: true                  # <bool:  turn on high-availability>
        ---
```

To create the cluster using the sample configuration file `config_file.yaml`:

```shell
biganimal create-cluster --clusterConfigFile ./config_file.yaml
```

!!!Tip
You can turn off the confirmation step with the `biganimal disable-confirm` command.
!!!

### Get cluster connection information

To use your BigAnimal cluster, you first need to get your cluster's connection information. To get your cluster's connection information, use the `show-cluster-connection` command:

```
$ biganimal show-cluster-connection --name my-biganimal-cluster --provider azure --region eastus
┏━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┓
┃ Connection String                                                                                                ┃
┣━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┫
┃ postgres://edb_admin@p-c5vtkei9slcqhepufrd0.brcxzr08qr7rbei1.biganimal.com:5432/edb_admin?sslmode=require        ┃
┗━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┛
```

!!!tip
You can query the complete connection information with other output formats, like JSON or YAML. For example:

```
biganimal show-cluster-connection --name my-biganimal-cluster --provider azure --region eastus --ouput json
```
!!!

### Update cluster

After the cluster is created, you can update attributes of the cluster including both the cluster’s profile and its deployment architecture. You can update the following attributes:

-   Cluster name
-   Password of administrator account
-   Private networking
-   High-availability
-   Postgres database configuration

For example, to enable high availability, use the `--high-availability` option:

```shell
$ biganimal update-cluster --name my-biganimal-cluster --provider azure --region eastus --high-availability true
```

To check whether the setting took effect, use the `show-clusters` command and view the detailed cluster information output in JSON format. For example,

```shell
$ biganimal show-clusters --name my-biganimal-cluster --provider azure --region eastus --output json | grep zone
    "zoneRedundantHa": true,
```

### Update postgresql configuration of a cluster
To be added.

### Restore a cluster
Restore a cluster's latest backup to a new cluster. the restored cluster can be a in another region and with different configuration, in the restore command you can specify new properties of restored cluster, or you keep using the source cluster's configuration.
To be added. 



### Delete a cluster

To delete a cluster you no longer need, use the `delete-cluster` command. For example:

```shell
$ biganimal delete-cluster --name my-biganimal-cluster --provider azure --region e\
```

You can list all deleted clusters with the `show-deleted-clusters` command and restore them from their history backups as needed.
